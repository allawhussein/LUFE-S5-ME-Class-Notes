# LUFE-S5-Mechanical-Engineering-Class-Notes
This repository is a collection of my notes for my 5th semester courses in mechanical engineering, the notes are taken in markdown format using vscode with vim extension.  
Each individual course is either taught in English or French, however notes will be English whenever possible.
